<p>Cryptograms are puzzles that replace each letter with a different letter, number, or symbol. Solve the puzzle by figuring out the correct letters. On this site, you can solve puzzles that we have created for you, enter cryptograms from others sources in order to solve online, or create cryptograms from your own quotes to challenge friends and family.</p>
